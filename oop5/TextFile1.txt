    >Create a set of classes that describe players playing a game of 3 vs. 3 basketball moving in a Cartesian plane court with two baskets,
	  along with a referee and a basketball. With the following requirements:

        -The size of the court is 10 x 10, a basket is 3 x 2, and both the ball and player is 1 x 1
        -Create methods that provide:
            --A list of players + location on the court
            --A list of players distance close to the referee sorted in ascending order
            --A method that denotes if a basket has been scored (only interested in the basket being scored)

    >Demonstrate your implementation by creating a game with arbitrary data.
